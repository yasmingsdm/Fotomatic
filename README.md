# Fotomatic - NOT READY YET

This project is a Code Academy project where I fized a broken version of a responsive design website on my own computer using a design spec.

I used HTML and CSS.

What I've practiced/learned:
- Following a design spec - You can check the design spec [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1/specs/fotomatic_spec_landing_v2.png?_gl=1*hlrpm3*_ga*NTEzNzQzNDM5OS4xNjY4MTYyMTI4*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3MTA5NTAxMy42MC4xLjE2NzEwOTU2NjEuMC4wLjA.);
- Fixing a code made for someone else;
- Responsive Design (CSS).
